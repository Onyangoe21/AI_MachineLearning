## About this Repository
* It can be daunting to learn new tools especially if they involve mathematical expressions. This repository aims to be a friendly documentation of these tools that is rooted in making them intuitive and not scary. As a contributor, think about things like examples most people would relate to better.
* This is a documentation that advocates for an intuitive way to learn tools in AI making them friendly to use. While you go through this document, feel free to add suggestions as to better ways to explain the existing tools that might be more intuitive.
* it is a good place for anyone just getting started with ML and wants to learn from another person's journey:
* With information everywhere on the internet, it might be useful to find an organized version that can be easily followed. 
* You will find two major folders:
    1. Machine Learning
    2. Experimental
* The machine learning folder is an organized folder of important hands on ML algorithms both for supervised and unsupervised Learning and the Experimental folder is just for misc files that might be useful.
* You are welcome to contribute to this repository with the mission of making it easier for people who use it to learn machine learning
* The mission is to grow it into a dynamic platform for recording recent changes happening within this field with new content showing up for new algorithms
* Please contribute to help us learn faster and add tips to the misc files.
