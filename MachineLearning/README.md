* Simplest way to put it is that ML is a way to make computers learn how to do tasks that they are not explicitly programmed to do.

* It could be supervised -- where we know the correct answers or unsupervised -- where we let the algorithms venture on their own finding patterns in data using techniques like regression.

* Any topics relevant to this repository should be added as a folder with the learning files within that folder: for example: MachineLearning -> SupervisedLearning -> Regression could be a folder with different things to know about regression
